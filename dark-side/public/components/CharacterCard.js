// you can build out an empty component as long as it has a return with an empty div
// this will help to get your App layout setup and really make you think like a developer

// make sure that the name of this component ALWAYS matches your file name! 
// you can write your function like this...or like this: 
// function CharacterCard() {

// }
// if you write it with the function keyword, you can then export your component in the same line rather than at the bottom
